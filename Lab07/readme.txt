This is part of my "Code Review" assignment. The original code is in the folder
called 'Original Code'. The code in the original file was purposely created to 
be garbage. So, after I reviewed it, I decided to make my own version that actually
works properly. 

-> Original version is called "dctionaryProcessor.pl"

-> My version is called "betterVersion.pl"

NOTE: make sure you read and understand what the code does before you run it, or
      you will get confused at all the random files that will be created
